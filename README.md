Detailed exploratory data analysis and gaining useful insights with univariate and bivariate analysis.

## Assuming we have a limited number of monitors (say only six to eight for any million-plus population city), then how to choose sites for deploying the sensors?
### A. Collecting information about the city
Before deciding on the locations of monitoring stations in the city, we need to gather some information about the city in following areas: 
<br>
**1.** Source of Emission For the industrial areas, we need to get the information regarding 
- Type and count of industries,
- kind of fuel used by them,
- their distribution on geographical plane.
For residential areas,
- Count and type of vehicles
- Fuel used by them

**2.** Health and demographics in order to capture how the air quality is affecting the health
of citizen of city, we need to get the information about the population first. A survey form can
be circulated among the citizen to record their response on how they feel about the air quality in
their area. This will help in shortlisting the locations in the city, especially in the residential areas
for the establishing a monitoring station. Generally, the stations are put where the population
density is high. However, other socio-economic factors are taken into consideration. The data
recorded by these stations can help in epidemiological studies of air pollutants on human health.

**3** Metereological Information This involves data collection of meterological parameters like : temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction. Monitors are fixed in the areas
which are downwind from the source at mixing height as Indian Meterological Department (IMD).



**4.** Topographical Information Mountains, hills, valleys and large water bodies can affect the
dispersion of pollutants. Thus it is suggested to put monitors in the area where spatial variation in
concentration is large. **5.** Previous Air Quality Earlier air quality data can also act as a basis
for shortlisting locations for establishing monitors.

### B. Selection of location for monitors
The main requirements for the selection of location of monitors: 

**1.** Representative Site
There are certain conditions that needs to be fulfilled before finalizing the location: 
- It should be representation site.
- It should be away from absorbing surfaces.
- Location should be representing site for a long time i.e. no interference in the surrounding e.g. construction.
- There should be free air flow available all the time. Thus, station should not be fixed in balcony, corner etc.
- Should be at least 25 m away form the pollution source like domestic chimney (WHO 1977) especially if
chiminey height is below the height of sampling point.

**2.** Comparability It is important that the data collected from different stations is comparable.
Thus, one needs to follow the guidelines provided in IS 5182 (part 14) 2000:
- It should be open from all sides, - For monitoring traffic pollution, sampling intake should be greater than 3 m above
street level. While for unpaved roads, the samplers should be kept 200 m above from them for the
protection from dust.

**3.** Physical requirements of monitoring site
  - Location should be able to be a representative site for a long time.
  - Easily accessible throughout year,
  - Should be protected from extreme weather conditions and vandals.
  - Site should have sheltering with facilities like water and electricity

**4.** Topographical and Meterological Factors Hills, mountains, valleys and large water bodies
can affect the pollutant distribution. Also, wind pattern can change because of heating up of wind
and day and its cooling in nights. This is could also change how pollutant flows. Thus these factors
must be kept in mind while fixing monitors.
The next step is to decide on pollutants or pollutant selection and to deploy sensors to record
for the same. Then, we check on sample duration and requirement, measurement methods, lab
requirements, quality assurance, and finally data handling and presentation.


### Distribution of monitors in the city
As per WHO 1977, the distribution of stations:
- 5 stations : 3 (Industrial / City Centre), 2 (residential)
- 10 stations : 6 (Industrial / City Centre), 4 (residential)

Upon interpolation, we get that for stations 6 or 8 distribution should be as follows:

- 6 stations: 4 (Industrial / City Centre), 2 (residential)
- 8 stations : 5 (Industrial / City Centre),3 (residential)
